## PipeWire Tools

[PipeWire](https://pipewire.org) is a server and user space API to deal with multimedia pipelines.It provides a low-latency, graph based processing engine on top of audio and video devices that can be used to support the use cases currently handled by both pulseaudio and JACK. PipeWire was designed with a powerful security model that makes interacting with audio and video devices from containerized applications easy. Nodes in the graph can be implemented as separate processes, communicating with sockets and exchanging multimedia content using fd passing.

[WirePlumber](https://pipewire.pages.freedesktop.org/wireplumber/) is a modular session / policy manager for [PipeWire](https://pipewire.org/) and a GObject-based high-level library that wraps PipeWire’s API, providing convenience for writing the daemon’s modules as well as external tools for managing PipeWire. The WirePlumber daemon implements the session & policy management service. It follows a modular design, having plugins that implement the actual management functionality.

[Core API](https://docs.pipewire.org/group__api__pw__core.html) is used by all clients that need to communicate with the [PipeWire Daemon](https://docs.pipewire.org/page_daemon.html) and provides the necessary structs to interface with the daemon.

[Implementation API](https://docs.pipewire.org/group__api__pw__impl.html) is primarily used by the [PipeWire Daemon](https://docs.pipewire.org/page_daemon.html) itself but also by the [PipeWire Session Manager](https://docs.pipewire.org/page_session_manager.html) and modules/extensions that need to build objects in the graph.

[SPA (Simple Plugin API)](https://docs.pipewire.org/group__api__spa.html) is an extensible API to implement all kinds of plugins.

### Audio Tools & Libraries to use with PipeWire

[JACK Audio Connection Kit AKA JACK](https://jackaudio.org/) is a professional sound server daemon that provides real-time, low-latency connections for both audio and MIDI data between applications that implement its API. JACK can be configured to send audio data over a network to a main machine, which then outputs the audio to a physical device. This can be useful to mix audio from a number of linked computers without requiring additional cables or hardware mixers, and keeping the audio path digital for as long as possible.

[JACK2](https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2) is a C++ version of the JACK low-latency audio server for multi-processor machines. It is a new implementation of the JACK server core features that aims at removing some limitations of the JACK1 design. The activation system has been changed for a data flow model and lock-free programming techniques for graph access have been used to have a more dynamic and robust system.

[OpenMAX™](https://www.khronos.org/openmax/) is a cross-platform API that provides comprehensive streaming media codec and application portability by enabling accelerated multimedia components to be developed, integrated and programmed across multiple operating systems and silicon platforms.

[H.264(AVC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC) is a video compression standard based on block-oriented and motion-compensated integer-DCT coding that defines multiple profiles (tools) and levels (max bitrates and resolutions) with support up to 8K.

[H.265(HEVC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Video_Coding) is a video compression standard that is the successor to H.264(AVC). It offers a 25% to 50% better data compression at the same level of video quality, or improved video quality at the same bit-rate.

[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) is a leading multimedia framework that can decode, encode, transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the cutting edge ones on multiple platforms such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.

[GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing. Applications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter technology transparently.

[Media Source Extensions (MSE)](https://www.w3.org/TR/media-source/) is a [W3C specification](https://github.com/w3c/media-source) that allows JavaScript to send byte streams to media codecs within Web browsers that support HTML5 video and audio. Also, this allows the implementation of client-side prefetching and buffering code for streaming media entirely in JavaScript.

[WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) is an open-source project that adds real-time communication capabilities to your application that works on top of an open standard. It supports video, voice, and generic data to be sent between peers, allowing developers to build powerful voice- and video-communication solutions.

## Wayland Learning Resources

[Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org) is a protocol for a compositor to talk to its clients as well as a C library implementation of that protocol. The compositor can be a standalone display server running on Linux kernel modesetting and evdev input devices, an [X application](https://www.x.org/wiki/XServer/), or a wayland client itself.
